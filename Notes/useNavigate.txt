import {usenavigate} from "react-router-dom";

Pass the path you want to navigate as the first argument and an optional object as the second argument.

const navigate=useNavigate();

navigate("/homePage,{state:{message:"Failed to submit},replace:true})

If you set the value of replace to true, React router will replace the current entry in the history stack instead of adding a new one. Both state and replace fields are optional.
